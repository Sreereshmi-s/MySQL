## MySQL: DDL Commands, Constraints, and DML Operations

### Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, constraints, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations in MySQL.

- DDL Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, and TRUNCATE are used to define and manage the structure of database objects like tables, schemas, and indexes.

- Constraints: Help enforce data integrity and ensure consistency within the database.

- DML Operations: Focus on manipulating data in tables, including inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

### Key Features
1. Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands
- CREATE: Defines new database objects (tables, schemas, etc.).
- ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects.
- DROP: Removes database objects.
- RENAME: Changes the name of existing database objects.
- TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table without deleting its structure.

2. Constraints
- NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
- UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
- PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- FOREIGN KEY: Establishes and enforces a relationship between columns in different tables.
- CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column meet a specific condition.
- DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified.

3. Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations
- INSERT: Adds new rows of data to a table.
- UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
- DELETE: Removes data from a table.
- SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
- MERGE/REPLACE: Combines data manipulation logic (if supported by the DBMS).
