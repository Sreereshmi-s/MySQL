# MySQL

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands and constraints in MySQL. DDL commands such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, and TRUNCATE are used to define and manage the structure of database objects like tables, schemas, and indexes. Constraints, on the other hand, help enforce data integrity and ensure consistency within the database.

## Key Features

### Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands:

- CREATE: Defines new database objects (tables, schemas, etc.).
- ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects.
- DROP: Removes database objects.
- RENAME: Changes the name of existing database objects.
- TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table without deleting the structure.

### Constraints:

- NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
- UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
- PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
